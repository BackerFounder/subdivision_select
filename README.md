Subdivision Select
===

*subdivision_select* is a Rails engine that provides a select form helper that
automatically loads subdivisions (states/provinces) of a country into a select
box. It works via AJAX, but doesn't require you to write any javascript.

'subdivisions' are also referred to as 'states' or 'provinces'. The terminology
comes from ISO 3166-2. This data is provided by the `countries` gem, via the
`country_select` gem.
